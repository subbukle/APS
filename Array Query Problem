Array Query Problem:

Look up table technique:
(In simple terms this technique can be defined as fetching of the prestored values.)
Processing Time - n^2
Memory Required - n^2
Access Time - 1

Kadane Algorithm:
It is used to find maximum sub-array sum of the given array.
Time Complexity - O(n), because it uses inly one for loop which traverse over the entire array length.
Space Complexity - O(1).

Square Root Decompositoin:
It is used if the arrar elements( number ) are changing.
Processing Time - n
Memory Requirement - square_root(n).
Access Time - square_root(n).

Segment Tree:
It is used when the given values aren't changing i.e, if it remains static and n is large value.
Total nodes - 2*n-1.
Time complexity for tree construction - O(n).
Time complexity for query os O(logn).
Time complexity for updating an element is O(log n)
If the values are changing then it gets difficult to change the arrangement of the constructed tree. It requires to redesign the entire tree.
