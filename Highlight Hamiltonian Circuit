Hamiltonian Circuit:-
#The number of ways a path can be traced such that all vertices are included in the path, the mathematical expression is given by---- n!.
Here n indicates number of vertices.
*The tracing can be either of the way that is first to last or last to first, therefore we divide the expression by 2. Therefore ----- n!/2.
*We also consider the combination of the vertices where the position of vertices change, therefor we have ----- n!/(2*n) => (n-1)!/2
