In some problem statements the solution or the result will be asked to be provided in the form of (10^9+7).
*Here (10^9+7) is a largest prime number which fits in the range.
*In case of division modular arithmetic is not applicable, therefore we take the inverse of second number thus convertinf it into multiplication 
and then we apply the operation.
* Carrying out the operation of %(10^9+7) in the preliminary stages is equal to performing hte operation on the final answer.
* It is not mandatory that only 10^9 +7 must be selected, but most of the platforms consider this as a standard thus using it is recommended.
