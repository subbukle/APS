Binomial Coefficients:
These are the positive integers which occur as the coefficients in binomail theorem.
Following ways computes the binomial coefficients. 
IMP: The range of the input (n aand k) and the application also decide which of the method must be chosen.

1) Using the concept of 2D Matrix, here we use pre-computed values.
2) Using recurssion.
3) Using 1D array to compute specific value.

*The first method is used when the values of 'n' and 'k' are large. One of the advantage of this method is the array location whose index ( ex: a[index]) value corresponds to k>n is not wasted as it is not used.
Space Complexity - n*k
This method also provides intermediate values.

*Here we recursively build the value of required binomial coefficient.
Space Complexity - 2^n-1
This method computes values independently for each recursive call thus it is slightly slower when compared to the previous method.

*This method is used when we require particular binomial coeficents.
Space Complexity - k+1
It is not good approach if we need to generate set of values.
